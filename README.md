# NanotubeGenerator
A simple MATLAB code for generating a nanotube based on Chiral coordination. The code is capable of generating the three most common type of nanotubes including zig-zag, arm chair and Chiral. The input for the code are the Chiral coordinates, length of the nanotube, and the bond length. The code outputs the atomic coordinates of the nanotube as well as the bond data for connectivity.
